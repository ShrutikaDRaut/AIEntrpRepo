This project is regarding Machine Learning models for breast cancer predictions.

For best accuracy two models are developed
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine

Both the models are trained for efficient predictions and saved as
1. logisitic_model.sav
2. svm_model.sav

The models are trained using dataset available as Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) DataSet in Kaggle
The dataset can be downloaded from the below URL,
